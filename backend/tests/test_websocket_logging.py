"""The WS manager's logging must never take a client down with it.

``event`` is structlog's own positional field. Passing it as a keyword raises
TypeError inside the log call itself — which, on the welcome message, killed
the connection before the client was ever usable. A dropped client means no UI
render target, so every SVG and layout thumbnail 503s forever. Cheap to assert,
expensive to miss.
