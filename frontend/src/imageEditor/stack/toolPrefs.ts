/**
 * Sticky tool picks — which tool is armed, not what it produced.
 *
 * A pick is a PREFERENCE, not part of the document: reaching for Patch, or the
 * lasso, or a particular inpaint provider says how this person works, and it
 * outlives both the image it was picked on and the window it was picked in.
 * The palette's recents already work this way; the rest of the toolbar didn't,
 * so every reload dropped the user back on Brush.
 *
 * What is NOT here: anything a step owns (a crop, a stroke, a shape) and the
 * transient landing states between gestures — `sub = null` after a one-shot
 * annotation is where the tool went, not what the user picked.
 *
 * One profile-scoped record rather than a key per pick, so two profiles never
 * inherit each other's provider and a read is one parse.
