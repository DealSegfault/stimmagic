/**
 * Shelf rules for open editors: order, capacity, and flyout grouping.
 *
 * An editor tab is a shortcut to an Asset, not a document that needs a name —
 * the op stack persists server-side against the asset, so removing a chip
 * removes the shortcut and nothing else. That makes the shelf a working set
 * rather than a list of things to keep alive, which is why it can be capped:
 * chips past the cap move behind a +N chip instead of growing the sidebar.
 *
 * Pure so the rules are testable without a DOM; see useEditorShelf.ts for the
 * live binding to workspace tabs.
